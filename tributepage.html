          <li><b>1894</b> - Albert finishes school. Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He moved to Milan with his family.</li>
          <li><b>1895</b> - Goes to school in Switzerland. Albert moved to Switzerland at 16 years old to attend Aarau Cantonal School.</li>

          <li><b>1902</b> - The patent office. Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.</li>
          <li><b>1905</b> - 	Submits his first paper. Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.</li>
          <li><b>1909</b> - 	A new job. After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.</li>
          <li><b>1911</b> - Attends physics conference. He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.</li>
          <li><b>1913</b> - Theory of gravity. He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.</li>
          <li><b>1919</b> - 	Einstein is famous. After publishing his Theory of Relativity and correctly predicting the effects of a solar eclipse, Einstein's name went around the world.</li>

          <li><b>1945</b> - War ends. World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.</li>
          <li><b>1955</b> - Einstein dies. Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.</li>
        </ul>
